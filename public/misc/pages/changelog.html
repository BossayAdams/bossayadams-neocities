                        <li>4/29/25 - New art, added redirects so the sidebar always shows up</li>

                        <li>4/24/25 - Happy anniversary to this website. Didn't plan anything special for it, but I 
                            added the <a href="./creatures.html">Creatures page</a>.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Week of 4/13/25</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4/17/25 - Complete site overhaul! I added an awesome navigation sidebar, lots of new 
                            styles, and cleaned up a ton of horrible code. God... Thinking about the old 
                            code makes me want to P*KE. Still unfinished in some parts, but I think it 
                            looks presentable enough right now.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>On this day, the greatest neocities webpage on Earth was registered, which, 
                            if it wasn't obvious, is the one you're on right now. I'd also like to note 
                            that this date is palindromic (if you ignore the slashes).</li>
